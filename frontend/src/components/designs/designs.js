                                             We had invited a particular local artist to make a design for a 2022 drop. He 
                                             developed a slick idea which became our second logo, simplistic design, 
                                             representing our colour theme, purple and yellow. If your keen to find

            <div className={css.logo_text_2}>As part of an opportunity, we got in touch with another newly starting brand,
                                             also skateboard oriented for a collaboration. We are proud to have got in
                                             touch with another great brand pushing the same message and content. With 
                                             this design the idea was to combine both logos effortlessly so we would have 
                                             chance to film edit and produce skateboarding videos the same way, merging 
                                             skate groups, creating friendships along the way. As part of this expansion, 
                                             https://vented-apparel-co.square.site/ created their second design and i have
                                             been able to create wider stock of Which can be found at ‘shop - hoodies’ with

                                             crown. Pink panther was our favourite cartoon character and it’s a popular 
                                             show, still to this day. This piece saw light in early 2021 and was available
                                             on hoodies, T-shirts, hoodies, bags… even stickers. An iconic and nostalgic
                                             design found worn at local skateparks and schools. The character has a massive 
                                             fanbase but pink panther clothing is rare, except for the limited HUF 
                                             collection…This design started the brand going with a bang but unfortunately
                                             stopped in late 21, because this brand cannot be tainted by another already 
                                             affiliated character, it doesn't seem fair to their creativity, but I hope to 
                                             bring similar style designs in 2023.
